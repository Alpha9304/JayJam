## Team Agreement
### Team Values
- <b>Collaborative Responsibility</b>
  - Each member is responsible for upholding our collaboration principles. We hold each other accountable to ensure mutual respect and engagement. We expect each member to provide a level of contribution that, while not necessarily uniform across all tasks, is deemed equitable by the entire team. In other words, the workload should be distributed in such a manner that no member has grounds for dissatisfaction regarding individual effort. Each individual should complete their assigned tasks and meet deadlines. If any member meets difficulties, the one responsible for the work should communicate with other teammates and ask for help.
- <b>Respectful Communication and Feedback</b>
  - Every team member is expected to practice active listening and offer constructive, unbiased feedback. Each individual should freely share their ideas, thoughts, and concerns without fear of discrimination. By respecting cultural and personal differences‚Äîand communicating respectfully in both verbal and non-verbal ways‚Äîwe would maintain an inclusive environment and strengthen overall team cohesion. Resolutions to any conflicts amongst the team should first be attempted by the team. If no agreements are reached, the course staff should be contacted. 
- <b>Participants</b>
  - All team members are expected to attend scheduled meetings and classes promptly and arrive prepared, in accordance with prior agreements. If availability changes, it should be communicated to other team members as soon as possible. Absent members are responsible for following up with the team and making sure their responsibilities are completed. Ultimately, the team‚Äôs success hinges on every member reliably contributing to shared objectives.

### Team Communication

- Developers will have a weekly meeting after class on Fridays 4-5pm.
  - Any member that must miss the meeting should notify group members at least 3 days prior (Tuesday or before).
  - Members that miss the meeting should get a short debrief on Slack of the topics discussed and any tasks that they may need to complete, including deadlines.
- Slack will be used for all communication and text for emergencies, and responses are expected in 12 hours, unless the person has notified the team of previous arrangements at least 3 days prior.
  - üëç for agreement or acknowledgment.
  - ‚úÖ to indicate completion.
  - Threads will be used to prevent the main chat from being cluttered.
- Any issues that may prevent the completion of assigned tasks should be proactively communicated.
- The 2 members working on the same user story should actively respond to each other (within ~8 hours) and between the hours of 10am-9pm.
