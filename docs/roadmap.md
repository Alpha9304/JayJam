# Project Roadmap

## Iteration 1

* **Dates:**

* **Goal: Establish the tech stack and ensure verification.**

* **Must-Have Features:**
  
  * [ ] As a student, I want to authenticate using my JHU email (not using the JHU login, just checking that it is @jhu.edu), so that my information is protected, and I know that I will only be interacting with other JHU students. 
  * [ ] As a student, I want to receive a confirmation email to the JHU email I provide, so that I verify that I’m a JHU student.
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to input my SIS iCal link (https://uisdxp.sis.jhu.edu/api/course/calendar/:userId), so that I can automatically join groups with other students in my classes.
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to logout, so that I can safely use my account on public devices. 

## Iteration 2

* **Dates:**

* **Goal: Ensure proper communication with SIS calendar links to add students to class groups, and implement meeting time suggestion with the help of Google Calendar.**

* **Must-Have Features:**
  
  * [ ] As a student, I would like the app to automatically connect to Google calendar and pull my availability into the main scheduling calendar, so that I don’t have to look at my calendar while entering my availability. 
  * [ ] As a student, I want the platform to consider my availability based on my calendar and suggest meeting times, so I can easily select a time that works for me. 
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to easily navigate between the calsses added with my SIS link, so that I can make plans in multiple classes.
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to mute notifications for a class, so that I do not receive unnecessary messages and updates.
  * [ ] As a student, I want to customize my profile with a name, picture, and other information, so that other students can identify me. 

* **Nice-to-Have Features:**

  * [ ] As a user, I want to be able to toggle between light and dark mode, so that I can match my viewing preference. 

## Iteration 3

* **Goal: Allow users to create meetings that others can join with functionality of choosing location and group size.**

* **Must-Have Features:**

  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to propose a study time and location, so other students can opt-in to attend. 
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to limit the number of other students that can sign up, so that booked study rooms can fit everyone.
  * [ ] As a student, after a study time has been finalized, I want to be able to suggest and have people vote on a meet up location, so we know where to meet.
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to leave events, so that I can opt-out if I double-booked.
 
* **Nice-to-Have Features:**
  
  * [ ] As a student, I want a personalized calendar in the app that I can edit, so that any events I add or remove automatically update my availability.

  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to send messages within a group, so that I can communicate with others in my class. 
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to delete my messages within a group, so that unintended messages don’t remain in the group.
  * [ ] As a student, I want to be able to edit my messages, so that I can correct myself without deleting the entire message.
